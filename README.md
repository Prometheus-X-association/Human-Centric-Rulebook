# Human-Centric-Rulebook: Data Contract Service  
Public Repository for work on the Human-Centric Rulebook project 

### The evolutions can concern two aspects of the project:


* The core technical infrastructure, this happens through the github and through the technical working of DASES/Prometheus-X
  -  You can subscribe here: https://prometheus-x.org/assemblies/dases-technical?locale=en
* The contract template used, this happens through regular expert workshops (once a month) that agree on clauses to adapt/add and this can then be added to the technical evolutions when needed to adapt the written contract to the ODRL implementation in the service
  - You can track the evolutions here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11d4mJ-aiTmrSjNMTVe_aO3PDk51W-3MC93nhHUHZJ7c/edit?usp=sharing
  - You can find the contract template here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Ft34NYAvFWui9-t9IrKV6znFoPi9jYD/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105421016601963875815&rtpof=true&sd=true
